Classification - Bank Marketing

The data used in this example is publicly available at the UCI Machine Learning Repository:
http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bank+Marketing

Please download the files and place the CSV-files in the same folder as the Classification example files.

BankMarketing.m is the main script that needs to be executed. You can execute this script section-by-section. 
It demostrates the use of different machine learning techniques for a classification problem.

BankMarketing_Refinement.m is an optional script that explores some techniques to understand importance of features and reduce the model complexity.

There is a bug in MATLAB R2013b and one needs to fix the code for ordinal arrays (for these code files to execute correctly) as mentioned in the bug report below:
